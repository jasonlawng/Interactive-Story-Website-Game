# Interactive-Story-Website-Game

This is another very old project that I made sometime during middle school. The interactive story game was a cool assignment, and it was one of the projects that I am most proud of.
Looking back on these old projects and seeing the kind of stuff that I wrote when I first started was really cool. Maybe my students will find this cool as well.
